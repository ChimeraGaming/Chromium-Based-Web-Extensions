# 🛒 Amazon Save For Later Organizer

Quickly scan and manage your "Save for Later" list on Amazon using a glowing, collapsible sidebar. This extension opens each saved item in a background tab, scrapes the full product name, and closes the tab — making your items easier to search and filter later.

### 🌟 Features

- 🔍 **Searchable Results**: Sidebar includes a live search filter to find any item fast.
- 🚪 **Smart Tab Scraping**: Opens each saved item in a tab, grabs the full title, then auto-closes.

### ⚙️ Performance Notes

- Speeds depend heavily on your internet connection and device performance.
- **More than 250 items** may start to cause UI lag.
- **More than 1000 items** may crash Chrome on lower-spec machines.
- Avoid running multiple scans at once for optimal results.
