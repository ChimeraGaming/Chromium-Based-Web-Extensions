- 🏟️ **Arena Mode (Optional):** Want more action? Enter the Arena for continuous focus battles with bonus XP rewards and combo streaks.
- 📜 **Daily & Weekly Quests:** Stay productive with rotating objectives like “Read 2 Articles” or “Avoid Social Media for 30 Minutes.”
- 📊 **Global Stats Page:** Track your lifetime XP, total levels earned, resets performed, hours logged, and more — even across class resets.
