# 📦 Stremio-Addons

Welcome to the **Stremio-Addons** repository by Chimera Gaming!

This repository hosts a collection of custom **addons** developed to enhance the experience of using [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/). Each addon is designed to bring new functionality, improve organization, and offer a more seamless media experience.

## 📚 Structure

- **Main Repository**:  
  A home for multiple standalone addons, each organized in its own folder.

- **Individual Addons**:  
  Every addon (example: "Chimera Folders") has its own subfolder containing:
  - Full, human-readable source code (`addon.js`)
  - `manifest.json` for Chrome Extension support
  - Icons and assets (if applicable)
  - Individual `README.md` with feature list and install instructions

---

## 🚀 Current Addons

- **Chimera Folders** (v3.0.1)  
  Organize your Stremio library into custom folders with a sleek sidebar UI, collapsible sections, and GitHub integration.  
  *(See the `Chimera Folders` folder for full details.)*

More addons are planned and will be released over time. Stay tuned!

## 🤝 Collaboration & Contributions
